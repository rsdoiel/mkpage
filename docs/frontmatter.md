# frontmatter

## USAGE

	frontmatter [OPTIONS]

### DESCRIPTION


*frontmatter* extracts a front matter from a Markdown file.
If no front matter is present then an empty file 
is returned. Note *frontmatter* doesn't process the data
extracted. It returns it unprocessed. Other tools can
be used to process the front matter appropriately.
By default *frontmatter* reads from standard in and writes
to standard out. This makes it very suitable for pipeline
processing or for passing JSON formatted front matter back
to *mkpage* for integration into the templates processed. 


### OPTIONS

Below are a set of options available.

```
    -examples            display example(s)
