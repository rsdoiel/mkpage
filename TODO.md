## Bugs

+ [ ] After April 17, 2018 use the new NOAA weather API for example in help and README.md (or replace with a new example)

## Next (road to v1.0.0)

+ [ ] **byline** should pickup a by line from front matter OR the regexp
+ [ ] **titleline** should pickup a title from front matter OR the regexp
+ [ ] **mkslides** should be depreciated in favor of **mkpage** using front matter to indicate an output format of slides.

+ [ ] Read in mkpage.toml, mkpage.json or mkpage.yaml for mkpage config
+ [ ] Add support for rendering remarkjs content
+ [ ] Add support for passing configuration to markup engine from front matter

    + Need to support possibly nested sitemap XML references
    + Review Hugo's sitemap support for ideas
    + Need some sort of front matter to identify where/if content would show up in sitemap
+ [ ] mkpage slide support needs to align with remarkjs
    + See https://github.com/gnab/remark, https://remarkjs.com and https://github.com/gnab/remark/wiki
    + [ ] Consider merging mkpage and mkslide (fewer tools less to learn), consider front matter changes
    + [ ] Add support for slide notes delimited by `???`
